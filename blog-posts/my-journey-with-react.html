<p>Over the past few years, I've had the pleasure of working extensively with React and TypeScript in production environments. This combination has become my go-to stack for building robust, maintainable web and mobile applications.</p>

<h2>Why React and TypeScript?</h2>

<p>React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable UI components, while TypeScript adds type safety that catches errors at compile time rather than runtime. This combination significantly improves developer productivity and code quality.</p>

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

<h3>Type Safety is a Game Changer</h3>

<p>Moving from JavaScript to TypeScript was initially challenging, but the benefits quickly became apparent. Type checking helps prevent bugs, makes refactoring safer, and serves as self-documenting code.</p>

<h3>Component Composition</h3>

<p>One of React's strengths is its composability. Breaking down complex UIs into smaller, manageable components makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.</p>

<h3>Hooks Changed Everything</h3>

<p>React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. useState, useEffect, and custom hooks make it easier to share logic between components without complex patterns like higher-order components or render props.</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p>Through experience, I've developed some best practices:</p>

<ul style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">
    <li>Keep components small and focused</li>
    <li>Use TypeScript strictly (no 'any' types unless absolutely necessary)</li>
    <li>Leverage custom hooks for reusable logic</li>
    <li>Write meaningful prop types and interfaces</li>
    <li>Use React.memo() and useMemo() judiciously for performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>

<p>The React and TypeScript ecosystem continues to evolve. I'm excited about new features and improvements that make development even more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
